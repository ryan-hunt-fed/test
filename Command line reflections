Command line reflection

Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?

I believe I went slightly over, I think this is mainly getting the right setup to work but I am adjusting how my screen is displayed so the time is also there. If I still seem to have the same issues later on I will be setting timers on top of the toggl track software. 

Name five commands you used and what they do.

Cd - Change directory
Mkdir - create directory
Rm -r - delete directory
Touch - create file
Pwd - check what current directory I’m in
Ls- list items in current directory

Did you learn anything unexpected?

Nothing I would say was unexpected, I have had some terminal experience in the past working in IT, so it’s just a matter of learning the commands that I am not used to yet.
